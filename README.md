# Fukzen
Fukzen is a Programming Language written in Python that aims to be [the opposite of it](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). 

#### The neZ of Fukzen:

* Ugly is better than beautiful.
* Implicit is better than explicit.
* Complex is better than simple.
* Complicated is better than complex.
* Nested is better than flat.
* Dense is better than sparse.
* Readability is meaningless.
* Special cases are always special enough to break the rules.
* Although impracticality beats impurity.
* Errors should ever pass silently.
* Unless explicitly raised.
* In the face of ambiguity, surrender to the temptation to guess.
* There should be many -- and preferably countless -- cryptic ways to do it.
* Although those may not be cryptic at first unless you're GuidoVR.
* Although *right* now is often better than never.
* If the implementation is easy to explain, it's a bad idea.
* If the implementation is hard to explain, it may be a good idea.
* Namespaces are one honking atrocious idea -- let's do none of those!

#### Brief history:

I've used to talk a lot about Python with a [fellow programmer](https://github.com/dhelbegor), and a lot of what I said was a critique to the Zen of Python (Mostly because countless python programmers can't even glimpse a lambda expression, that they start [making references](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and to vaguely criticize your code at random). He said that he had a dream that we were developing a programming language called "Antizen", and that he woke up laughing. As soon as I've learned that, I've started what now is Fukzen. Even though I know that the combination of lambdas and list comprehensions and maps and things from functools can become real nasty real fast, I've always believed that their reactions were exaggerated and that they were somehow indirectly influenced by the Zen of Python. I mean, Python should be flexible, and have both function-driven users and non-function-driver users. It's possible to write nasty and implicit code in any language, but the Zen of Python gives the right to many folk to think that it's their bible and that they should annihilate dreadfully those who summon a lambda expression.
