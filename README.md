The !Zen of [NO-PITY-ON]

Ugly is better than beautiful.
Implicit is better than explicit.
Complex is better than simple.
Complicated is better than complex.
Nested is better than flat.
Dense is better than sparse.
Readability is meaningless.
Special cases always are special enough to break the rules.
Although impracticality beats impurity.
Errors should ever pass silently.
Unless explicitly raised.
In the face of ambiguity, surrender to the temptation to guess.
There should be many -- and preferably countless -- cryptic ways to do it.
Although those may not be cryptic at first unless you're GuidoVR.
Although *right* now is often better than never.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking atrocious idea -- let's do none of those!
